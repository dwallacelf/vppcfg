vppcfg (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  Bugfix release:
    * Fix python load / include paths, now vppcfg runs relative to $PATH
    * Partial fix for 'make test' (doesn't execute the YAMLTest suite yet,
      this has no impact to production)
    * Bugfix: correctly prune vxlan tunnels which have an address set
    * Lint: address a few pylint errors
